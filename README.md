**Flutter GitHub User Search**

This is a Flutter app that allows users to search for other GitHub users using the GitHub API. The app displays the searched user's username, profile picture, and follower count.

**Getting Started**

1.  Clone or download the repository.
2.  Open the project in your preferred Flutter environment.
3.  Run the app on an emulator or physical device.

**Using the App**

1.  Enter a GitHub username into the search bar and press the search button.
2.  The app will display the searched user's information, or a message indicating that the user was not found.
3.  To search for another user, simply enter a new username into the search bar and press the search button again.

**Future Plans**

I plan to continue improving and expanding the app's functionality in the future. Some ideas I have include:

-   Adding the ability to view the searched user's repositories.
-   Implementing pagination to allow users to view more search results.
-   Adding a "favorites" feature to allow users to save their preferred users for quick access.
